            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior student at American University of Central Asia studying Software Engineering. 
                I am actively improving my skills in Web programming. I have 8 month experience of work as a 
                frontend engineer. At the beginning, I had internship at LLC TimelySkills, where I worked together 
                with other engineers. We built web applications for widespread use. Then I worked in the university 
                team of developers. I also have my own social project, where I built web application for the Public 
                Association of Gardeners Maki. I was able to talk to the client, design the application and deploy 
                the project on the internet. The goal of the project was to attract peopleâ€™s attention to the problems 
                of ecology in Kyrgyzstan. Furthermore, I learn other languages, such as Java and Python. I am interested 
                in building neural networks.
